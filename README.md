# fishPhinder

This project is designed to take a list of safe websites as an input and based on that it will try various permutations of those websites + conduct image and text analysis to allow people to quickly identify and evaluate if/when a suspicious item is found, the idea is that screenshots of these phish websites can then be automatically tweeted out for alerting
